The University of Pittsburgh is hosting a **border patrol [recruitment event](https://pitt.joinhandshake.com/stu/events/1896598)** on Thursday, February 26 (which they've tried to cover up by deleting the [event page](https://imgur.com/a/Qjz5pzG)!). This is part of a broader **Customs and Border Protection [recruitment program](https://careercentral.pitt.edu/jobs/u-s-customs-and-border-protection-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-officer/)** that Pitt's advertising to the community.

At the same time, Pitt is [staying silent](https://www.pittgradunion.org/updatefebruary-19-2026) on whether **ICE** can enter campus spaces without warrant. **Pitt's negligence puts our international colleagues in danger.**

We need to coodinate and tell Pitt to protect our international colleagues. **Pledge to call Vice Chancellor Pickett on [this form](google.com).** Once you've signed up for a time, call him at **[412-648-4685](tel:+14126484685).** In addition to calling, you can also feel free to email him at [**cwp19@pitt.edu**](mailto:cwp19@pitt.edu). You can use the sample scripts below or write your own. 

**Sample phone script**

> Hello,
>
> As a Pitt community member, I'm calling because I'm appalled that Pitt is advertising openings for border patrol agents and staying silent on whether ICE can enter campus spaces without warrant. Pitt's actions and compliance make me ashamed to be part of the Pitt community.
>
> Instead of giving empty words of support as in your previous email, Pitt needs to take action and protect our international colleagues. I demand that Pitt cease to promote CBP/ICE recruitment to the Pitt community. What actions will you take to make that happen?
